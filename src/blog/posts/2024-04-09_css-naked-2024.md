Another travel mini-post, but it's time-sensitive that I post something today in particular. Literally less than an hour ago at time of writing, I learned about [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io/) from a [Mastodon post](https://social.coop/@eb/112237659633479022) and immediately hacked together some Javascript to disable CSS here on April 9. 

I love this idea because (1) it's the kind of goofy unserious fun that you just can't do on a centralized social media platform, and (2) there's some pretty glaring layout issues on this site that CSS was effectively wallpapering over, and that I now know about to fix.
