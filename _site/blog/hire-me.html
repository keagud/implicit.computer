    <h1>Perhaps Consider Hiring Me</h1>
    <time datetime="2024-04-17"</time>
    
    <p>Despite programming and/or doing some kind of computer stuff for... geez, literally the majority of my life, time just keeps ticking huh. Anyway, despite that, I don't have a lot of external signifiers to that effect. I took at lot of computer science-adjacent classes in college, but my major was linguistics. If I'm talking to a human I can of course just say &quot;yes, I do not have the correct words on my diploma, but I assure you I know computer things&quot;, but the unfeeling machines that haunt the byways of <a href="http://indeed.com">indeed.com</a> cannot be reasoned with. As such, I've found it very difficult to make any headway in my job search.</p>
<p>So I've decided to switch up my tactics - today I passed the second of the two required exams for the CompTIA A+ certification ðŸ¥³</p>
<p>With a certification in hand to make my skills <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State">legible</a> to our algorithmic overlords, I now cast my message to the digital winds with renewed hope and vigor: <em><strong>I am looking for work!</strong></em></p>
<p>Specifically, something in entry-to-mid-level IT or development in the greater Seattle area (or remote anywhere in the US). You can see all my specific skills and keywords on my <a href="https://implicit.computer/resume">resume</a> (PDF version <a href="https://implicit.computer/resume.pdf">here</a>), but here's the Big Picture:</p>
<p>I have spent an ungodly amount of time poking and prodding at computer stuff. No matter what happens in the future, I will be poking and prodding at computer stuff until I pass on to the Great Hereafter; until that day comes, though, I do require such mundane things as food and shelter. So I'm proposing a deal: I will poke and prod at your company's computer stuff to make it better, in exchange for money that I can exchange for goods and services necessary to my survival. The poking and prodding is happening anyway, but this way you can benefit from it!</p>
<p>If you are in a position with the potential to make my dream of professional level poking and prodding a reality, my email address is on the <a href="https://implicit.computer/resume">previously linked resume page</a> (my professional email, not the implicit.computer address for website-related things, although you're free to mail that one as well of course)</p>
