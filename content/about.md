# About Me
I'm Keaton, I live in the Pacific Northwest and I like computers. I work in IT doing network-y stuff. Previously, I wrote internal software for a manufacturing company; before that, I was a graduate student in [audiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology). 

I'm on [github](https://github.com/keagud) as well.
