# About Me
I'm Keaton, I live in the Pacific Northwest and I like computers. Previously, I wrote internal software for a manufacturing company; before that, I was a graduate student in [audiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology). Currently I am unemployed.

I'm a longtime GNU/Linux user and Free software aficionado. I use [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) (stable) as my main daily driver distro. I also used [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) for a stretch, and will probably return someday. 

I'm on [mastodon](https://social.lol/@keagud) and [github](https://github.com/keagud) as well.
