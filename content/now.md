I'm unemployed and in kind of a liminal phase as I try to find a stable-ish place in the tech ecosystem. I'll be taking both the Network+ and Security+ exams later this month and most of my time now is spent on preparing for that in some capacity. 

## Working On
Pretty exclusively stuff that will help me get a job - studying for the afforementioned exams, polishing my resume, etc etc. 

One big advantage (?) to being a Computer Person is that every task can become a fun programming project with a bit of creativity, so to that end I've been learning a lot about rendering HTML/CSS into a PDF for my resume and writing various associated scripts to automate it. It's a bit fiddly, but still way less so than LaTeX!
