## General
I'm unemployed and in kind of a liminal phase as I try to find a stable-ish place in the tech ecosystem. Junior/intermediate developer positions are basically nonexistent currently, so I'm pivoting to more of an IT generalist skillset. In the meantime I'm living with family, which I'm very lucky to have as an option, but it's also made me *really* motivated to get my own place again.

## Working On
- [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/index.html)

## Reading
- *Kraken* by China Mi√©ville

## Learning
- Mostly material for the CompTIA A+ and Network+ exams, plus I'm trying to build some better intuitions on how the Internet works at the technical level.
