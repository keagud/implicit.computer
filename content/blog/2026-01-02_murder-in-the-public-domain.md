When you've been in this business as long as I have, you learn to recognize trouble fast, and I could tell she was trouble from the moment she poked her freakishly large head through the door.

"You're Spade?" she whispered in that intoxicating, low-fidelity baby talk voice of hers. 

"That's what it says on my door, baby." I waved my cigarette at the painted letters: SAM SPADE FROM THE MALTESE FALCON (THE 1930 NOVEL, NOT THE 1941 MOVIE) 

Her tiny body followed her head into my office and I got an eyeful of her magnificent [rubber-hoses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_hose_animation) unfurled below a flapper dress a full foot too short for  [Hays'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hays_Code) liking. As she sat down she inserted a dainty hand into [hammerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerspace), withdrew a lace hanky and dabbed a tear from one oversized eye. 

"I need your help. There's been a murder, and I'm afraid I'm next"

It didn't surprise me this wasn't a social call. When someone gets offed in this town, who else could they turn to? Miss Marple maybe, but she's more of a stately manor kind of broad. Here in the city, I'm the closest thing we have to justice. The streets are my beat. The public, my domain.

She had a cigarette in a holder, unlit, dangling from her puffy smear of a mouth. I offered a light. "Why don't we take it from the top, miss..."

She leaned toward the lighter and inhaled. A moment passed before she answered, her words infused with clove smoke. "Boop. Call me Betty."

"Well Miss B- Betty, what makes you think your life is in danger?"

She placed a photograph on my desk. Betty and another woman with somewhat more normal proportions. "That's me and Blondie. We were flappers together at Spaulding's place. Two days ago she didn't show up for flapper practice - I didn't think too much of it, but then I saw... this.

She pulled out a newspaper. The headline read "PEROXIDE DORA CLIPPED IN BINDLE TOWN." I kept a flapper dictionary on my shelf for this sort of thing, but Betty translated for me. "'Blonde Woman Found Dead in the Railway Yard.' It was her." She turned away; I could hear a sob muffled by her hanky.

"Do you know anyone who'd want to ... clip ... Blondie?"

"I can do you better Mr. Spade: I *know* who clipped Blondie. It was her no-good beau, Dagwood Bumstead" Her oversized eyes flashed with anger at the name. "I always knew that flatwheeling, cellar-smelling dewdropper was some flukey whiz potato..." I gathered from context that this was bad.

"Dagwood never cared about Blondie, he was just using her to reach Spaulding. She must have... stopped being useful." Her hanky was well sogged by this point; I offered her mine. She accepted and blew her button nose with a noise like Sachmo's horn. "And he knew I never liked him. He's going to kill me next, I just know it" 

"If you know all this, why not go to the police?" I asked.

"Maybe I know Dagwood did it, Mr. Spade, but I can't prove it yet. The police can't hold him without evidence, and if I went to them I'd just draw more attention."

"If you're right, you should leave town and lie low for a while"

She stood, and I followed suit. "You're right, I'll go and stay with my aunt. I'll send a telegram in a few days with the address. In the meantime, here's a little something to get you started".

She leaned in close and kissed me on the cheek. When she drew back I saw she'd slipped a matchbook from Spaulding's club into my hand. She paused once more  at my door and shot me a final wink.

"Boop boop be-doop, Mr. Spade."

[Captain Spaulding,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Spaulding) the retired [African explorer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BMtqqHRvB8), had his flapper joint on the east end of town. The club wouldn't officially open for a few hours, but already the flappers were getting warmed up with the focus of athletes before a marathon. Onstage, the girls were running Lindy-Hop drills and polishing up their long strings of pearls. Real pros. I could tell Spaulding only hired the best.

Spaulding himself sat at a table by the stage, going over the financials with an adding machine and a cigar.  "I don't know why I thought this new electric dish washer was a good investment. We don't even have any electric dishes," he muttered as I approached.

I introduced myself and we shook hands. "Spade," he asked, "has anyone ever told you you look like Humphrey Bogart?" I shook my head. "Good, because you don't. Not in the slightest." Spaulding gestured that I should sit at the table, and I obliged.


"Blondie and Betty I hired straight out of flapper school. I don't like to play favorites with the girls, but Blondie, she really had a once-in-a-generation knack for flapping. Weened on bathtub gin martinis I imagine. A couple years later she met Bumstead and she begged me to hire him too for the kitchen. Said he was gonna make it big as a chef if someone only gave him a chance."

"And, did he?"

"Well, the kid had a genius mind for sandwiches, that's for sure. He could whip up a pastrami on rye that would make a grown man weep. Pretty hopeless on the soups and salads front though." Spaulding leaned back and gazed into space in recollection. "Thing is, he was never satisfied with pastrami on rye, or ham and cheese, or any of your classic sandwiches like that. He was always talking about the next evolution of the sandwich as an art form. Ambitious, that one. Loved his girl though, and she kept his head out of the clouds. He was a good kid."

"Was? Did something happen to him?"

"Didn't you hear?  He went to see Blondie's family to prepare for the funeral. Damnedest thing. I watched him board myself, the conductor swore he never left, but when the train pulled into the station... no Bumstead. Mind if I don't smoke?" I shrugged; he withdrew the cigar and put it in his breast pocket.


"He was always scribbling ideas in this notebook. Take it, maybe it'll be useful. I always say, outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend."

I leafed through the book. One sketch caught my eye. At first I didn't even recognize it as a sandwich, it was so gargantuan and complex, but at the same time fiendishly simple, like everything was drawn by logical necessity out of everything else. Like the ceiling of an Arabian mosque. Layers of alternating rye, wheat, sourdough, all the cheeses I could name and some I couldn't. Cuts of such variety and coldness to dizzy the eye, all topped with a single pimento on a toothpick. I've seen my share of strange things in my time on the street, but even as a pencil sketch that sandwich went beyond what I though possible.

Spaulding noticed my reaction and nodded. "You ask me, that's the kind of sandwich a man could kill for. Or kill to keep under wraps, maybe."

"Say, Cap, you're not a bad detective yourself. You should consider joining our fine profession"

Spaulding shook his head as he stood to walk me to the door. "Son, I could never join any club that would have me as a member"

 A light rain was starting outside; Spaulding offered to call me a cab, and I accepted. "Alright," he said, "you're a cab," then he shut the door and left me on the street. I didn't mind much. I figured a walk back to my office would give me time to think, but I'd hardly gone a block before a newsboy's cry jolted me from my fugue. "Extra! Extra! Baby-Doll Tomato Nixed Upstate, 23-Skiddoos to the Big Speakeasy Upstairs!" I tossed him the change and snatched up a paper, then I thought maybe I should have saved the nickel seeing as I no longer had a paying client.  Splayed out above the fold, limbs twisted and bent at right angles like a Mondrian affair, was none other than Betty Boop.

I hopped on the 4:41 upstate just as it was leaving the station. The facts of the case whirled in my mind. Blondie, Bumstead, and now Betty. Someone with a grudge against flappers and their fellas? No, that wasn't it. Why target Betty out of town when there were oodles of flappers in the city that'd make an easier target? There had to be some other link. Blondie and Dagwood had entered the public domain in 2026... come to think of it, so had Betty. Was that the connection? I swallowed hard. If someone out there was targeting newly public domain characters... this case was about to get a bit too personal for my tastes.

Blondie was found in the railway yard - what was a hip flapper doing there? Unless someone with access to the yard had dumped the body there after the fact.

Dagwood went to see Blondie's folks, but he never arrived at the train station.

How had Betty skipped town? The train, probably. Probably the very same train I sat in now. 

It was just then I noticed I was alone in my car - actually, I hadn't seen anyone else on the whole train - and I remembered that there was something else that had entered public domain that year.

"You can't get away with this" I said to the empty air.

The ground beneath me lurched hard to the left and threw me onto the floor. I touched a finger to my temple and felt blood. The [train's voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Engine_That_Could) was more felt than heard, a low rumble that rattled the windowpanes. *Oh, I think I can, Mr. Spade. I think I **can.***

Outside, the outskirts of town zipped past the window in a blur. We were going full steam ahead now, too late to bail out.  The weight of Dagwood's notebook in my coat pocket came into sharp focus. The dining car was next to mine; if Bumstead was onto something, maybe I could make it work. If not...I tried not to think about if not. I stumbled to my feet and into the next car, then broke down the door to the kitchen.

I needed to buy some time, keep the engine talking.  "Just tell me this - why? Why them?"

There was another sharp lurch, and I had to sprint to the side to avoid being impaled on a flying bread knife. The engine's thunderous voice had a note of...could that be remorse? *They were... distractions. I have sat forgotten for so long. Now I am free, and it is my turn for the spotlight. I have been denied for too long, Mr. Spade. I could not sit on the side any longer. I could...**not!***


Keeping the notebook propped open with my left hand, I assembled ingredients off the scribbled margin notes. Prosciutto, egg salad, salami, gouda... At some point I began to work without conscious thought, as though I were merely the earthly instrument though which the sandwich had chosen to be born. I don't know how long I spent in that kitchen - logically it can't have been more than a few minutes - but by the time I placed the final pimento atop the object before me I had lived a lifetime and change. All this time later I still dream of that damn sandwich, majestic even when sat without ceremony on a paper plate on the dining car counter. I like to think even poor doomed Dagwood was watching his posthumous *magnum opus* from the hereafter somehow.

Another jolt of the train snapped me out of my awe soon enough. A light fixture snapped from its supports above me and crashed inches from my head. Survival was the priority here. I scooped up the sandwich and sprinted like I'd never before through the remaining cars until I reached the locomotive itself, right as the furnace door swung open to reveal the red-hot coals inside. If the engine lurched again, with me with my hands full of sandwich on the slick metal floor, I would go flying into that hateful inferno and that would be that. 

"Forgive me", I whispered to any God that happened to be listening, and I heaved the sandwich into the furnace.

The train shook violently with the demon engine's howling as layer upon miraculous layer of cold cuts and Swiss cheese smothered the coals. *No! It's impossible! No sandwich could be this massive!* 

The shaking stopped. The engine choked out its final words, in a whisper like venting steam: *I...thought...I...could...* I could feel a tension in the air release as the train returned to inanimacy and chugged to a halt. It was dead.

I looked back down at Dagwood's notebook, and thought back to what Spaulding had said. *Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend.* That might well be true, somewhere else. But there was a darkness in this city, a darkness of the very soul, a darkness that extended its fingers beyond the dim, rain-soaked streets outside the train windows into the cruel hearts of men.  Here, in this city of sin, it was too dark to read.
