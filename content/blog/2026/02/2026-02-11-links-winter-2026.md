[COSTCO FAHRENHEIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gcgv3_JvE4) (Video)

General recommendation for [Matt Lakeman's travel blog](https://mattlakeman.org/), and specific recommendation for his most recent piece: [Notes On Afghanistan](https://mattlakeman.org/2026/01/05/notes-on-afghanistan/). Whenever I see a post from Matt in my RSS client I know my next 2-3 lunch breaks will be well spent.


Similarly, a general recommendation for [Mr and Mrs Psmith](https://www.thepsmiths.com/) and a specific recommendation for their most recent post on [traditions of esoteric writing](https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/joint-review-philosophy-between-the)

[The CARI Institute Index of Aesthetics](https://cari.institute/aesthetics). Tag yourself, I'm "cassette futurism"

[On Troubleshooting](https://www.autodidacts.io/troubleshooting/) as a distinct skill in itself. This jives well with my experience as something of a professional troubleshooter; in particular the power of "strip the system down to the smallest subset that works, then add components back in until it breaks" cannot be understated. 

Bringing hacker culture back to its anti-authority roots: [Gadgets for people who don't trust the government](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DW_F4rEaRduk) (Video)

A [mesofact](https://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/02/28/warning_your_reality_is_out_of_date/) is information that changes just slowly enough that you might assume it to be immutable, but quickly enough to become outdated over your lifetime. Fun examples: pluto is a planet, dinosaurs were slow and scaley. Less fun, socially harmful examples: [left as an exercise for the reader]


In high school I was pretty into the [SCP Foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com), a collaborative wiki-style project for short-form speculative, often [ergodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_literature) fiction in a shared universe. I recently re-discovered it and read through the [top pages](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/top-rated-pages-by-year) from the past few years and found, to my surprise and delight, that it holds up *way* better than most other things I was into in high school. Some of my favorites:

- [SCP-2602, which used to be a library](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2602)
- [SCP-7179](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7179) (warning for violence and body horror)
- [SCP-3930](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3930) "Description: SCP-3930 does not exist"
- [SCP-6614](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6614) "Description: SCP-6614 is the collective designation for multiple manned landings on the Moon believed to have been achieved by various anomalous means"
- [SCP-2317](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2317) There's a lot of entries that play with the idea of telling a story through multiple iterations of the same file, but I think this one pulls it off best.

Speaking of things I was a fan of in high school that are still good - from Hank Green: [Why New Year's Eve Sucks Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMWPs75q2_Q) (Video). The whole video is worth a watch, but my summary of the core thesis is: our major common cultural institutions are owned by corporations now, who have scrubbed them clean of anything resembling the authentic human experience in the name of "branding" and "image". This sucks, but it doesn't mean we can't make *new* cultural institutions outside of corporate reach, and in fact creating culture is something we humans are innately quite good at.  I can't help but think of the "small web" of personal blogs as a success story of creating culture outside of corporate control.
