Imagine for a moment you are Miles O'Brien, Chief of Operations on Deep Space Nine, formerly Transporter Chief on the USS *Enterprise*, and all around stand-up guy. You're doing your job as usual, beaming some people down to Earth for a Starfleet shindig when - Oh no! It's the cold open of a *Star Trek* episode (DS9 S03E11 to be exact)  and some certified Sci-Fi Nonsense is going down! Thanks to the buildup of... chronoton energy? Ok, let's go with that I guess - your boss and your best frenemy are stranded somewhere in Earth's past! Also Jadzia is too but you don't really have a relationship with her so idk? 

Even worse, something they did in the past changed the present timeline so humanity never invents warp travel, meaning there's no Starfleet and no Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communism.  Luckily you and your crew were insulated from those changes by *mumble mumble* chrono*mumble*, so now it's up to you to fix history. And you need to do it quickly - it's a 2 part episode but you're the B-plot, so screen time is limited. 

First you need to find out when exactly your buds ended up. You've narrowed it down to a handful of dates from about  1900 - 2100, but you don't have enough magic time sauce to investigate all of them.  You even run a level one diagnostic and for once that doesn't solve the problem! What do you do? 

(At this point feel free to mull over the problem to your satisfaction before continuing)


As a trained Starfleet engineer you of course instantly recall that the canonical solution to this kind of problem is binary search, and put together a plan:

1. Arrange the possible target dates chronologically and select the one in the middle.
2. Use some of your magic time sauce on the transporter to beam to that date, bringing with you a handheld computer that includes historical details on that time period from your exhaustive Starfleet records[^1].
3. See if this timeline still differs from the records. Since you have a tricorder with future technology powers it should be simple to scan every communications channel and collect the relevant data, or maybe there's just a telltale residue of wumbumbus particles or whatever left behind when the timeline is altered
4. If the timeline is disturbed, you know your crewmates must have arrived *earlier* to introduce the disturbance. If it's unchanged, they must have arrived *after*. In the first case, eliminate all later dates from consideration, and in the second eliminate all earlier dates.
5. Repeat from step 1 with the new pool of possible dates.

Now instead of *n* doses of magic time sauce to check *n* dates, you merely need *Log(n)* doses. Much more achievable! You're able to locate and retrieve your pals, fix the timeline, and go back home to your beautiful wife and daughter with a story of how you saved the universe with the power of intro-level computer science. Roll credits.


Anyhow that's what O'Brien *should* have done. In the actual episode they just picked dates at random to check and got lucky. Now I am reduced to writing a post correcting *Star Trek* on computer science, very possibly the dorkiest thing I have ever done.  

Boy, I hope somebody got fired for that blunder!

[^1]: Of course it'd be preferable to bring *all* your historical records, but that'd be what, *terabytes* of data? Sure it's the future and you have FTL travel and matter replicators, but you still can't just carry that much data in your pocket, that's absurd. So it'll have to be just the relevant slice of the records.
