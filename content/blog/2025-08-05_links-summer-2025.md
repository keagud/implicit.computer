[My Own Private Binary: An Idiosyncratic Introduction to Linux Kernel Modules](https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/txt/mopb.html)
: An excellent technical writeup of implementing a new executable format as a kernel module that avoids the twin traps of writing about Linux internals: neither too esoteric nor too shallow. My main takeaway, though, is that you can write define a new format for an executable as a module, load the module, and execute a file in that format *without rebooting at any point!* Windows, what the hell are you even doing.

[Demystifying the Shebang](https://crocidb.com/post/kernel-adventures/demystifying-the-shebang/)
: If this were my post I'd have called it "The Whole Shebang." Nevertheless, it's an interesting exploration of how execution works on Linux and a nice companion piece to the previous link

[Writing a basic Linux device driver when you know nothing about Linux drivers or USB](https://crescentro.se/posts/writing-drivers/)
: The title summerizes the post neatly, but I'd argue the author is selling themselves short to say they don't know *anything* about Linux drivers. It's also impressive that you can do at least basic stuff over USB with very little code.

[What the Hell is a Target Triple?](https://mcyoung.xyz/2025/04/14/target-triples/)
: We'd expect a "target triple" to be cleanly dividable into three parts (like Gaul) right? So how does that work out for  `x86_64_unknown-linux-gnu`? What's that, this has a *fourth* triple entry? Surely something as important as specifiers for compliation targets would be standardized, right? It wouldn't be a morass of historical baggage with no clear and unambiguous answers, right?  Right?

[Porting Tailscale to Plan 9](https://tailscale.com/blog/plan9-port)
: Really, *Plan 9* before FreeBSD?  (still cool though)

[The Entire History of Cat Memes (Video)](https://youtu.be/PKdUvW8fMj0?si=unZNePC41NohzGsd)
: I did not intend to watch an hour long video about cat memes in one sitting, and I certainly did not expect that video about cat memes to provoke a geniune aesthetic response from deep within my soul. But I did, and it did, and you should as well.


[Hang on, are there ANY lost minerals?](https://edconway.substack.com/p/hang-on-are-there-any-lost-minerals)
: <blockquote> <p>A few months ago I promised to write a series of posts documenting the world’s lost materials. I was quite excited about it; over time I was hoping to build up a catalogue of all of those substances humanity once used to mine and extract from the earth’s crust, but have now been exhausted. </p>
<p>
All of which is why it’s about time I informed you, dear readers, that I failed. After a single post (Malachite) I’m taking the decision to retire the Lost Materials series. Why? Because in trying to hunt around for minerals we have run out of, I came to an unexpected conclusion. So far, we haven’t really, meaningfully run out of, well, pretty much anything

[The Balatro Timeline](https://localthunk.com/blog/balatro-timeline-3aarh)
: Impresario that I am, I [wrote](/blog/next-fest-02-24) about the Balatro demo way back in March of 2024; since then the game has sold a morbillion copies and spawned a unique Roguelite sub-subgenre in its own right. Also since then, I personally have spent a truly inadivsable amount of time playing Balatro.  I think one hallmark of great art is that it seems obvious in hindsight - Balatro's different systems hang together so well and form such a concise aesthetic and mechanical whole it seems almost a logical necessity that the game would end up as it did - but this piece from the developer is a remender that it takes a lot of work and iteration to make something that looks effortless.

[Obituary: Daniel Calhoun, murine music author, dies at 132](https://ctrlcreep.substack.com/p/obituary-daniel-calhoun-murine-music?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)
: Short science fiction story formatted as an in-universe obituary. It reminded me of [lena](https://qntm.org/mmacevedo) by qntm, probably my favorite piece of internet-native sci-fi, period.

Special shout-out to friend of the blog [Wyatt](https://wyatscarpenter.github.io/blog) with two posts from him I recently enjoyed: [Thrownness as a condition to overcome](https://wyattscarpenter.github.io/blog/thrownness_as_a_condition_to_overcome.txt),  [Levels of busyness](https://wyattscarpenter.github.io/blog/levels_of_busyness.txt)

As part of my recent effort to learn more about the Internet I was reading the Wikipedia page for [Autonomous Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)) (tl;dr: the high level "chunks" of the Internet managed by individual ISPs), when it struck me that I, at that moment, had to be accessing this page via an AS myself. Which one? Who does it peer with, and who owns it? It was while searching for answers to those questions that I found [bgp.tools](https://bgp.tools) and had some fun getting a more concrete image of how the Internet is "shaped"


And speaking of concrete, [brutalist.report](https://brutalist.report) is a minimally styled link aggregator for (mostly tech-related) news sources. I was thinking about making a site like this not long ago, but this is way better and more complete then I'd ever manage.
