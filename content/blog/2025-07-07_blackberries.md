It's early July, which here in the Pacific Northwest means the roadside blackberries are starting to plump up and ripen. 

We do have a native blackberry species here in Washington: the Pacific blackberry, [*rubus ursinus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus_ursinus), a "prickly vine with slender trailing stems which grows in open to dense forests" as per the [Washington Native Plant Society](https://www.wnps.org/native-plant-directory/236:rubus-ursinus). I think I've seen a Pacific blackberry bush exactly once in my twenty-some years living here, in a wilderness preserve. The massive bramble walls encroaching on every highway west of the Cascades and north of the Columbia, however, composed of stiff tangled canes rather than "slender trailing stems", represent the [Himalayan blackberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus_armeniacus), which as you might guess from the name is *not* native to the region.[^1] it's the same old story - our traditional American blackberry is being undercut by an Asian import. Sad!

The Himalayan blackberry has been spectacularly successful in its ecological conquest of the northwest coast. I can't overemphasize just how ubiquitous the roadside blackberry bush is in western Washington, and especially in the suburban areas just east of Seattle. If you do not actively choose otherwise, any unattended patch of dirt - a vacant lot, the center of a roundabout, that strip between the street and the sidewalk- will become a blackberry bramble as the default option. Clearing out unwanted brambles is such a daunting perennial (heh) task we can only entrust it to God's Hungriest Soldier, [the noble goat.](https://web.archive.org/web/20220120202847/https://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Rent-a-goats-gain-foothold-1240623.php)

Something like 10 months out of the year the brambles are mostly background scenery and a stage hazard for pedestrians, but roughly from July through August they start paying rent and we're all reminded why we call them blackberry bushes in the first place. Because the bushes grow literally everywhere, for that 2 month window you can find fresh,juicy blackberries literally everywhere. In your yard, in the park, on the little path between the parking lot and the office, you can just grab a berry and eat it and no one can stop you. 

And a wild blackberry truly hits different. Probably a lot of it is tied up in context; the absolute *decadance* of plucking a berry off a bush and popping it in your mouth is tremendous. Probably also part of it is selection bias, since a berry snack is both more available and more appealing when I'm out on a trail run or cycling trek, and thus already jonesing for glucose. But I do think even on the pure gustatory level the bus stop blackberry is superior to the $6/lb premium Whole Foods blackberry. A ripe wild berry is juicier and less overtly sweet than one from the store, and while you'd likely still want the sweeter, more homogeneous grocery store berries for a pie or the like, the wild Himalayan reins supreme in my view for snacking.


In case the entire previous post didn't make it clear, I love blackberries and I love blackberry season. I love seeing serious men in suits picking their breakfast at the park-and-ride. I love seeing kids with purple-stained mouths staggering under the weight of heaping baskets in the park. For one season we can all put aside our differences and come together to agree on a single primordial truth: berries are really yummy and it rules when there's a lot of them.
