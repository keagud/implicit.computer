Like most of my generation, and the generation after me for that matter, playing Minecraft was a formative childhood experience, and while I haven't kept up with the many, many updates since 1.0 there's elements of the game that've taken up permanent residence in some deep cranny of my psyche. 
One of them is the main menu. 

<img style="margin: auto;  max-width: 400px;" src="/images/2025-10-09/minecraft_title.jpg" />

The yellow text, splashed diagonally over the main title, is the topic of this post.
That text is randomly selected from a pool of short text snippets each time the menu is loaded. 
The text and its placement evoke an ad slogan, and often it leans into the resemblance by referencing classic ad copy snowclones ("As seen on TV!",  "Ask your doctor!", "12 herbs and spices!"). 
At other times it's a shoutout for another game the devs like ("Also try Terraria", "The creeper is a spy!"), a political expression ("Information wants to be free!") or just a pun ("Bread is pain!"), but it still keeps the quippiness of an ad tagline.  

I stopped playing Minecraft regularly sometime around 2017, but I was reminded of this again recently when playing [Megabonk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/), a recent indie release with a main menu designed as a clear homage, randomized yellow text and all. 

If it were just Minecraft and its direct successors I'd be content to call this "Minecraft title text" but did Minecraft actually invent this trope? 
Possibly for video game title screens specifically, but not in general.
Look at the opening caption in the intro of [Futurama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F1QNfmiqHc) and tell me you don't see the resemblance to the Minecraft/Megabonk style of title-text. 
TV Tropes categorizes the Futurama opening caption as a [Couch Gag](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouchGag) and the Minecraft/Megabonk menu text as a [Randomized Title Screen](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomizedTitleScreen), but I think this division by medium is too artificial; all those examples intuitively have more in common with each other than any does with the original Simpsons couch gags, or for that matter with the Team Fortress 2 main menu screen, which includes a random game character but no random text. 

There's one other example of this kind of text that's especially important to this website: this website. 
Just below the site title, there's a randomly chosen short piece of text (sorry RSS users, you'll need to visit the site for this one). 
So, how did I refer to that text in the source?

```html
<p class="dynamic-quote-item">Gluten free!</p>
```

"dynamic quote item" doesn't really roll off the tongue, but in my defense, naming things is famously one of only two truly hard problems in computer science [^1].  

There's no naming consensus for the category on the Internet in general either, so it falls to me to coin one. The runner-up term from my research was *[dek](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dek#Etymology_1)*, an old newsroom term for the bit of text under the headline that's not quite a headline but also not part of the article body. That captures the literal typography part pretty well, and it's fun to say, but a dek in a newspaper doesn't quite fit in with the other examples here. 
The Minecraft wiki refers to the menu snippets as *[splash text](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Splash),* or just a "splash". 
I'm not thrilled with that term either, as it incorrectly implies something confined to a [splash screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splash_screen), but of the alternative words I investigated it's the snappiest, and it's what's already used to refer to what is, for a lot of people, the single central example of the phenomenon, so it's what I'll use going forward. 

The common ancestor of splash text in all its forms is the classic 20th century advertising slogan:

<!-- https://d12r87knhq09bn.cloudfront.net/uploads/2012/02/d00068.tifx_0.jpg -->
<img style="max-width: 400px;" src = "/images/2025-10-09/coke.jpg" />

But splashes are not themselves slogans in the same way as "it's the real thing."
They're *parodies* of slogans.  They're meta-jokes; they [lampshade](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging) the status of the work as a commodity and play it for laughs. 
Or, they take advantage of the special non-diegetic status of marketing copy to speak directly to the audience without shattering immersion entirely. 
A tagline for a novel can reference the world outside the narrative ("Now a major motion picture"), but a character *within* the novel making a comment about the upcoming film adaptation would shatter the reader's suspension of disbelief [^2]. Similarly, Minecraft could (and did) include splashes referencing COVID-19 during the pandemic, but COVID-19 being referenced during actual gameplay - the "text" of the work - would invite some uncomfortable questions. Does that imply Wuhan also exists in the world of Minecraft? What about *Tiger King?* 

Not all jokey or meta slogans are splashes, however.  
Splash text is additionally distinguished by being unique for each installment or instance of the work; for serialized content like a TV show, it's different for every episode; for software, it's different each time you boot up the program or load the webpage (As far as I can tell this aspect is an innovation from Futurama, but I'd welcome earlier counterexamples.) 
Each issue of *[Army Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Man_(magazine))* magazine ran with the tagline "America's Only Magazine," exactly the kind of absurd self-referential quip that belongs on a Futurama title card, yet  because it was the same line on every issue it's not a splash.
The unpredictability can be seen as a parody of advertising as well - a slogan builds brand association through constant repetition, but a splash intentionally *avoids* such repetition. 


With all that in mind, here's my first pass for a definition of *splash text:*

<quote>
<em> 
Text, evocative of a slogan or tagline, presented alongside the title of a work and unique for each instance or installment, that functions as a joke, commentary, or aside to the audience about the work on the meta level
</em>
</quote>


Any taxonomy like this is at its most useful when used to highlight the fuzzy cases on the border.
The second-to-last line in the *Animaniacs* opening song *would* meet all the criteria if it were presented as text: it's a self-descriptive hyperbolic slogan about the show itself that's different for each episode. 
If you're watching *Animaniacs* with subtitles, does *that* count as a splash? Maybe!


On the other hand, this definition doesn't mandate anything about tone or genre. 
Even if all the examples discussed here are comedic or comedy-adjacent, there's no reason you *couldn't* use splash text for dramatic effect.
I wasn't able to find any examples, but there's a first time for everything.
