A [cognitohazard](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cognitohazard) is information that is directly harmful when perceived. To distinguish the term from regular negative memes, a cognitohazard must inflict its harm *directly*; knowledge that the McRib is back is arguably a hazard for some people, but there's an additional step required between the knowing and the harm (going to McDonalds). For a true cognitohazard the knowing *is* the harm.  I'll limit my examples since I like my readers and do not want to inflict psychic damage upon them, but here's a very benign one: you are now breathing manually.

A cognito*helper,* a word I just made up, is information that is directly beneficial when perceived, in the same manner that a cognitohazard is harmful. I'll refer to cognitohelpers and cognitohazards collectively as *cognitoactive*, because it's my website and I can coin as many terms as I want.  

Does information need to be true to be cognitoactive? I don't think so, but all else being equal a true cognitoactive agent would be more effective than a false one, for the same reason that, all else being equal, a true meme will out-compete a false meme[^1] - when something is true, it's corroborated and mutually reinforced by other true memes. Compliments and insults can also be thought of as trivially cognitoactive, but that's not especially interesting.

I can only think of one unambiguous example of a cognitohelper and it is, to my knowledge, true. Here it is: **sleep-like rest isn't as good as real sleep, but it's measurably better than nothing.**  Sleep depravation has obvious negative effects on cognition and coordination, but if sleep just isn't coming, sleep-like rest - i.e. lying down in a dark room with your eyes closed -  is [better](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56033-6) than not even trying to rest. Meaning, if you can't fall asleep, you can still get *some* of the benefits of sleep by acting like you're sleeping anyway.  When I have trouble sleeping I often get fixated on the fact that I'm not sleeping and I'm going to be exhausted tomorrow if I don't fall asleep right this second, but, fate being a cruel mistress, this is an attitude actively at odds with falling asleep. It's better to shift your goal from sleep to closed-eye rest - first, because that's more attainable and still has benefits over doing nothing, and second, because removing the fixation loosens up the brain and makes full sleep much more likely. It's a true fact that grants a direct, immediate benefit just by believing it.


Some other examples I'm less sure about: 

- Arguably the [Four Noble Truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths) are the original cognitohelpers, albeit ones much tougher to fully grok and benefit from than the above. 

- The mechanism of action for [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) could maybe be seen as instilling cognitohelpers that counter maladaptive thought patterns.


If you have more examples of nontrivial cognitohelpers that can be communicated concisely without loss of efficacy, like the sleep example above, send 'em to me at [cognitohelpers@implicit.computer](mailto:cognitohelpers@implicit.computer), and if you're cool with me using them in a future post (with credit or anonymously, your choice), include that in your message as well. Or at least try to spread that knowledge in some other way, it's free utility!

[^1]: Emphasis on the "all else being equal" part. There are obviously tons of false memes that out-compete true ones, but that's because they're more effective on some other axis like emotional weight, pragmatic utility, etc.
